## Dashboard 1: Housing Prices in Arizona
Example of a dashboard that helps a user explore housing prices by county in Arizona. The data was found on [Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/moezabid/zillow-all-homes-data "Data Location") website. The data was not in friendly format for Tableau so preprocessing was done with this [Jupyter Notebook](./data_preprocessing.ipynb).
